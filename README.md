This code is was used to produce plots for the two-part paper
"Faster Lead-Acid Battery Simulations from Porous-Electrode Theory"

[I: Physical Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01771)

[II: Asymptotic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01774)

## Usage

- See an interactive plot of results: `python3 EXAMPLE_constant_current_discharge.py`
- Produce plots that are being used in the papers: `python3 plots_for_paper.py`
- Do parameter fitting: `python3 parameter_fitting.py`
